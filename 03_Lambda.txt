Lamda functions: serverless code

    Pros:
        Autoscaling
        No infrustructure to provision and maintain
        Bill on cpu usage per milisecond
        Multiple programming languages
    
    Cons:
        Cold starts: delay on function start at the first time
        Limited execution time 
        Vendor Lock: code has been change to deployed to other vendors

    Triggers: 
        Http, CLI, aws services (s3..), schedule interval(cron expression) via CloudWatch
    Lamda components:

        Functions: small stateless computing that execute code in response to event
        Applications: serverless eventdriven computing 

    Code: create a function from scratch

        def lambda_handler(event, context)

        lambda_handler function as the main starting point for your code
        event: infrmation about what trigger the function
        context: tools for function(how much memory, how many time hav to execute)

    How to deploy:

        Create a zip with code and runtime libraries
        Upload it to s3

        In function go to Settings -> Code -> Upload and set the s3 url
        In Runtime section 
    
    Test:
        I can test the function in the consol by sending test events and params as json
